## I've always been fond of models. 

When my mother and I relocated from the Bronx to upstate NY, I coped by building a Lego replica of my previous elementary school (it was a spaceship too - those years were cast from impressions of Bill Watterson's Calvin & Hobbes). We moved from a high-rise apartment building into a long-fallow farm. In the following years, I charted each step of the retired pastures and made notes about defensible high-ground (Starcraft: Brood Wars ruled my strategic designs), good cache locations, and the shady places where wild blackberries could ripen, unscorched, through August. 

I process my world by sketching, graphing, and building facsimiles of it. It makes sense that I would have an affinity for authors who do the same: Speculative Fiction is a type of derivative model. The author extrapolates about how a model might present, usually to entice attention to the current climate.

## But here's the challenge with scale-models: 

<blockquote>
<p>"One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to
oneself or to the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The
more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory. The most accurate map possible
would be the territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless"</p>

</blockquote>

There's natural tension when authors scaffold their model: how do you convincingly deconstruct culturally pervasive ideas, without boring your audience to indifference? Sue McGregor's "Consumerism as a Source of Structural Violence" has a much shorter reach than JG Ballard's "Kingdom Come", for example.

So, I would like to share a list of my favorite topical conversation starters. These are some of the titles I own (sometimes in multiplicate) to lend over and over again.

## "SQ" - Ursula K. Le Guin (published in the _The Compass Rose_ 1982)

##### _Mental Healthcare Industry, DSM Criticism_

"SQ" is merrily ludicrous. This short story is about a binary mental health scoring system. A Sanity Quotient score splits society into two categories: <50 SQ (Sane), >50 SQ (Insane). The diagnosis, re-education, segregation, and incarceration of insane people becomes the world's most lucrative and essential industry. 


## _The Circle_ - David Eggers (2013)

<img src="/assets/covers/the-circle-david-eggers.jpeg" class="col-md-3 pull-left img-rounded" />

###### _Ubiquity & Reach of Big Data, Digital Privacy, Social Media Culture, Content Generation_

David Eggers is not always subtle. The man wrote _"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"_. The Circle is an unabashed satire about public/private ownership, transparency, and a skinner box of constant social feedback. The story is told in a highly conventional third-person narrative style. 

Some passages read like a product teaser ripped from [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/).

## _Transmetropolitan_ - Warren Ellis & Darick Robertson (1997-2002)

<img src="/assets/comics/transmetropolitan-election.jpg" class="col-md-3 pull-right"/>

##### Two Party System, Consumerism, Aestheticization of Violence, Media Conglomerates, Trans*

Spider Jerusalem is a vulgar, drug-addicted sci-fi journalist made in Hunter S. Thompson's image. He's overtly anti-authoritarian and a survivalist - the series opens with Spider returning from secluded mountain bunker to The City.

I love this series, it's a joy to recommend. Spider's scathing reports about two-party puppet governments are underpinned by dystopian details in every frame. Muppets have been replaced by Sex Puppets. Police are outfitted in military-grade technology and are entirely for sale. Society is Balkanized by myriad religions, immmense class stratification, and Trans*Humanism. 

An uncanny twist of surreal and so-real!

## _Oryx and Crake (MaddAddam #1)_ - Margaret Atwood (2003)

##### Transgenics & Capitalism, Suburban Flight, Bioweapons

<img src="/assets/covers/oryx-and-crake-margaret-atwood.jpg" class="col-md-3 pull-left" />

Food-grade animal engineering keeps the first world flush with fresh meat. Affluent, educated workers live in corporate compounds protected by private military-police (a sharp nod to Suburban Flight). Margaret Atwood succinctly describes the way civilization collapses: <span class="spoiler">A bioweapon, seeded through populations via a prophylactic-cum-aphrodisiac pharmaceutical, kills everyone.</span>

The MaddAddam triology pairs familiar cultural references with a severe, disturbing narrative about humanity.
